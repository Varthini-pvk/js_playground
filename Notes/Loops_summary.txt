JavaScript Loops & Iteration — Summary Notes
🎯 Core Takeaway:

JavaScript loops are more flexible than Java’s because JS supports functional looping (like .map(), .forEach()), iterable-based loops (for...of), and object property loops (for...in).
Each loop has a specific purpose — choosing the right one makes your code clean, efficient, and readable.

🔹 1. forEach() — Perform an action for each element

Use when: You want to run code for each array element, but don’t need to return a new array.

sytax <array>.forEach((currentvalue, index, array) => {//steps})

currentvalue is mandatory


✅ Key Points:

Runs once for each element.

Cannot use break, continue, or await.

Common for logging, UI actions, or printing.

🔹 2. map() — Transform data (returns a new array)

Use when: You want to create a new modified array from existing data.

✅ Key Points:

Returns a new array.

Doesn’t modify original data.

Best for transforming test IDs, strings, or selectors.

Cannot use await.

🔹 3. for...of — Iterate over values of iterables (arrays, strings, maps, etc.)

Use when: You need readable syntax, support for break, continue, or await.


✅ Key Points:

Works on arrays, strings, Sets, Maps.

You can use await inside (important for Playwright).

Cleaner than traditional for loop.


🔹 4. for...in — Iterate over object keys

Use when: You want to loop through all keys of an object.

✅ Key Points:

Gives keys, not values.

Works on objects, not arrays (arrays → use for...of).

Does not preserve order.

⚠️ Note: Can pick up inherited properties (not ideal for Maps).

🔹 5. Object.entries() — Cleaner key/value loop for objects

Use when: You need both key and value directly.


✅ Key Points:

Converts object → array of [key, value].

Works perfectly with for...of.

Cleaner alternative to for...in.

🔹 6. do...while — Run at least once

Use when: You want a loop to run once before condition check.

✅ Key Points:

Condition checked after execution.

Great for “try until condition met” logic.

🔹 7. Loop Control — break & continue

Use when: You want to control the flow of a loop.


✅ Key Points:

break: exit loop early.

continue: skip current iteration.

Not available inside .forEach().

🔹 8. Nested Loops (Matrix or Combination Use)

Use when: You need to combine two sets.



✅ Key Points:

Useful for generating combinations (like test case pairs).

Nested .forEach() works for small sets; prefer for...of for async work.

🔹 9. .entries() on Arrays — Get index and value together

Use when: You want index + value with for...of.


✅ Key Points:

Avoids manually tracking index.

Very clean syntax for enumerating test steps.

🔹 10. Looping with Async (await)

Use when: You must execute async actions in sequence (e.g., Playwright clicks).


✅ Key Points:

for...of supports await.

.forEach() does not wait for async actions.

Crucial for sequential UI test steps.

⚡ Bonus Concept: Why not map() for looping over strings?

.map() is available only on arrays, not strings.

"automation".map(...) ❌ invalid.

Use for...of to iterate characters in strings.


🧭 Overall Learning Themes

JS loops are data-type aware (object vs array vs string).

Async control is only possible with for...of and while/do...while.

.map() and .forEach() are functional, not control loops.

Object.entries() bridges the gap between objects and array-style iteration.

You now know when to use each construct efficiently — critical for writing clean Playwright automation and modern JS code.
